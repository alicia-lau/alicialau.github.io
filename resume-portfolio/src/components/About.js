            <p>
                Hi, I'm Alicia! Trained as a mechanical engineer and fueled by a passion for software engineering, I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering, complemented by a minor in Japanese from the University of Rochester.
                Embarking on a career path that melds rigorous engineering principles with cutting-edge software solutions, I have developed a profound enthusiasm for innovation and a commitment to lifelong learning.
                Now, as a dedicated software engineer at Capital One, where I completed the Technology Development Program (TDP) in February 2023, I apply a unique mix of disciplined engineering approach and creative problem-solving abilities.
